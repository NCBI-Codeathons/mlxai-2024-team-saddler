## What software (if any) exists to help your project?

- [ChemCrow](https://github.com/ur-whitelab/chemcrow-public)
  - ChemCrow is an open source package for the accurate solution of reasoning-intensive chemical tasks.
  - Built with __**Langchain**__ (Python-based LLM Framework), it uses a collection of chemical tools including RDKit, paper-qa, as well as some relevant databases in chemistry, like Pubchem and chem-space.

## What software (if any) exists to help your project? (2)

- Streamlit (Python DS Web Application framework used for ChemCrow)
- Docker (Compose)
- PostgreSQL
  - pgvec extension
- Azure OpenAI models (Access through ToxPipe funding)

## What metrics will you use to measure performance?

- Human eval
  - Dr. Scott Auerbach
- Automated LLM eval in the future, not feasible during codeathon
- More information about long-term goals in the README.md

## What data will you use?

- Sources already included with ChemCrow
  - [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)
  - [rdkit](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/Overview.html#what-is-it) (PostgreSQL extension)
- Unstructured text like [NTP Technical Reports](https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/publications/reports/index.html?type=Technical+Report)
- [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/)
- [PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)

## What is your planned workflow for the codeathon?

- Still in progress
